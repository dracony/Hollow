Hey there and welcome to **Hollow**. In itself Hollow is a fast file blogging platform, but we decided to take it
one step further and make the content easily editable by anyone.

If you wish to tell the world about something, anything, perhaps write a cool tutorial or showcase your project you can
post it to this site. Just [fork Hollow on Github](https://github.com/dracony/Hollow) and write your post in the /posts 
folder. I'll be pulling commits to the server as frequently as I can to make sure people see your post as soon as possible.

Why post to Hollow instead of to your own blog? Well a lot of people don't really have a blog, 
because they don't feel like updating it. Usually if I have something to share I just post it to reddit,
but the markup there is inconvenient for long posts. Also by using hollow and adding features to it (like maybe a prettier header ?)
you make all posters that little bit happier. Try it out =)
